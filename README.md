#### <em> "Life is like chess and I don't know how to play it" - BerserkSpirit_99</em>

If this is about you, now you have a great opportunity to learn how to play life, and specifically chess. If you think
you already know how to play, try to beat our smartest bot - EUGENE (spoiler, you will not * evil laugh *)
<p><b>How to run project</b><br>
<li> There are file with rules, called RULES.txt (we definitely do not recommend reading it)</li>
<li> Then in directory "source" run script "build.sh"</li>
<li> Executable file "test" will be stored there as well</li>

##### At this stage of the project development:

<li> Project Logical Structure Defined</li>
<li> The logic of the movement of classical figures is implemented: pawn, horse, elephant, rook, queen, king</li> 
<li> The logic of classical moves is implemented: simple move, castling, taking on the aisle, turning a pawn (into a queen)</li>
<li> Verification of position on shah, mat, pat, draw due to lack of figures</li>
