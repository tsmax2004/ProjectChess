# Project Chess

### How to run project
<li> In directory "source" run script "build.sh"</li>
<li> Executable file "test" will be stored there in the same directory</li>

#### At this stage of the project development:

<li> Project logical structure defined</li>
<li> The logic of the movement of classical figures is implemented: pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, king</li> 
<li> The logic of classical moves is implemented: simple move, castling, en' passant, promotion of a pawn (into a queen)</li>
<li> Verification of position on check, checkmate, stalemate, draw due to lack of material</li>
<li> Implemented game cycle</li>

<br/>
For checking our progress you can run "test" and play a game. <br/>
Input format: 'cell from' 'cell to'. <br/>
For example, e2 e4 moves a pawn from e2 to e4. <br/>
